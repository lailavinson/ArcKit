/**
 The central class for interacting with LocoKit location and motion recording. All actions should be performed on
 the `LocomotionManager.highlander` singleton.
 
 ## Overview
 
 LocomotionManager monitors raw device location and motion data and applies filtering and smoothing algorithms to 
 produce a stream of high level `LocomotionSample` objects, a composite representation of the device and user's 
 location and activity state at each point in time.
 
 Locomotion samples include filtered and smoothed locations, the user's moving or stationary state, current
 activity type (eg walking, running, cycling, etc), step hertz (ie walking, running, or cycling cadence), and more.

 #### Energy Efficiency
 
 LocomotionManager dynamically adjusts various device monitoring parameters, balancing current conditions and desired
 results to achieve the desired accuracy in the most energy efficient manner.
 
 ## Starting and Stopping Recording
 
 To start recording location and motion data call `startRecording()`, and call `stopRecording()` to stop.
 
 #### Update Notifications

 LocomotionManager will send `locomotionSampleUpdated` notifications via the system default 
 [NotificationCenter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notificationcenter) when each new location 
 arrives.

 #### Raw, Filtered, and Smoothed Data
 
 LocoKit provides three levels of location data: Raw CLLocations, filtered CLLocations, and high level
 location and activity state LocomotionSamples. See the documentation for `rawLocation`, `filteredLocation`,
 and `LocomotionSample` for details on each.

 #### Moving State
 
 When each raw location arrives LocomotionManager updates its determination of whether the user is moving or stationary, 
 based on changes between current and previous locations over time. The most up to date determination is available
 either from the `movingState` property on the LocomotionManager, or on the latest `locomotionSample`. See the
 `movingState` documentation for further details.

     The maximum desired location accuracy in metres. Set this value to your highest required accuracy.
     
     For most uses the default value will achieve best results. Lower values will encourage the device to more quickly
     attain peak possible accuracy, at the expense of battery life. Higher values will extend battery life, at the cost
     of slower attainment of peak accuracy, or in some cases settling on accuracy levels below the best attainable by
     the hardware and sensors.

     - Note: If `dynamicallyAdjustDesiredAccuracy` is true, LocomotionManager will periodically adjust the
     internal CLLocationManager's `desiredAccuracy` to best match the current best possible accuracy based on local
     conditions, to avoid wasteful energy use and improve battery life.

     - Warning: Setting a value above 100 metres will greatly reduce the `movingState` accuracy, and is thus not
     recommended.

     #### GPS, Wifi, And Cell Tower Triangulation Thresholds
     
     - iOS will usually attempt to exceed the requested accuracy, and may exceed it by a wide margin. For
     example if clear GPS line of sight is available, peak accuracy of 5 metres will be achieved even when only 
     requesting 50 metres or even 100 metres. However the higher the desired accuracy, the less effort
     iOS will put into achieving peak possible accuracy.
     
     - Under some conditions, setting a value of 65 metres or above may allow the device to use wifi triangulation
     alone, without engaging GPS, thus reducing energy consumption. Wifi triangulation is typically more energy
     efficient than GPS.
